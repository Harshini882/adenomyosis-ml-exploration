# Adenomyosis – Machine Learning Exploration
Beginner-level exploration of machine learning concepts using adenomyosis-related data.

This project is a beginner-level exploration of how basic machine learning concepts
can be applied to structured data related to adenomyosis.

The focus of this project is to understand:
- how data is loaded and explored
- what features and labels are
- how a simple model is trained
- how predictions and accuracy are checked

This project is for learning purposes only and is not intended
for clinical or diagnostic use.
